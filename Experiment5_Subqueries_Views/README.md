# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**

Write a SQL query to Find employees who have an age less than the average age of employees with incomes over 1 million

Employee Table
```sql
select * from employee where age <(select avg(age) from employee where income>1000000);
```

**Output:**

Table Name: Medications (attributes: medication_id, medication_name, dosage)

```sql
select *from Medications where dosage=(select max(dosage) from Medications);
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders generated in New York city. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

```sql
select * from orders where salesman_id IN(select salesman_id from salesman where city='New York');
```

**Output:**


<img width="1255" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb0ce9d7-f02a-4199-9cb2-e8101e52ab8f" />


**Question 7**
---

```

**Output:**

```sql
select department_id,department_name from Departments where LENGTH(department_name)> (select avg(LENGTH(department_name)) from Departments);
```

**Output:**


<img width="963" height="365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c87cef6-d3d7-4484-9292-351f4d73dfb1" />

**Question 10**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $4500.
